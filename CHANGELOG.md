# Changelog

## [v0.2] - 2025-01-XX

### Changed
- **Improved model**: Switched from LinearRegression to Ridge regression with regularization (alpha=10)
- Enhanced generalization through L2 regularization
- Slightly reduced model complexity

### Model Performance Comparison

#### v0.2 (Ridge)
- **Algorithm**: StandardScaler + Ridge (alpha=10)
- **RMSE**: 54.12 (**↓ 1.6% improvement**)
- **R²**: 0.467 (**↑ 3.3% improvement**)
- **Model size**: ~5KB (similar to v0.1)

#### v0.1 (Baseline)
- **Algorithm**: StandardScaler + LinearRegression
- **RMSE**: 55.02
- **R²**: 0.452

### Rationale
The Ridge regression model provides better generalization by penalizing large coefficients, reducing overfitting risk. This is particularly important for clinical applications where model stability across different patient populations is crucial.

### Technical Changes
- Added Ridge regression with cross-validated alpha parameter
- Maintained same preprocessing pipeline for consistency
- No changes to API interface (backward compatible)
- Docker image size remains ~200MB
